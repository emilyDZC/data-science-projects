# data-science-projects

A collection of projects I completed during the Udemy course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning".

The projects are created in Jupyter Notebooks, and all use the common data analysis and visualisation libraries **pandas**, **numpy** and **matplotlib**, as well as [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) for more comprehensive plots, and **plotly** and [**cufflinks**](https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks) for interactive charts.

Machine learning is done using [**scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries.
